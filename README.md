# Infinite Pacman
Pacman, but a little bit longer.

This program is Pacman made in c++.
There are 3 classes: player, ghost, game and 2 threads - one for player
second for ghost.
There is only one ghost, but when he step on empty spot, he leaves a point there.
Thanks to that, one can play really long.
The ghost is also available to see the player.
His sight equals 7 fields in a straight line by default but function takes it as argument so it's easy to change.
Board is loading from .txt file.
At the end You can see Your score. 
Enjoy!
